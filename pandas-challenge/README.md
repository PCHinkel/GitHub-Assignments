# Pandas Homework - Heroes Of Pymoli 3 Observations

Note: The dataset focused on the users who bought items, so the observations are focused on the trends of users that buy items unless stated otherwise.

#1

"Other / Non-Disclosed" users are on average likely to buy more expensive items than the "Male" and "Female" users.
"Other / Non-Disclosed" users have the  highest "Average Purchase Price" AND the highest "Avg Total Purchase per Person".

#2

"Female" users will on average make more purchases than the "Other / Non-Disclosed" and "Male" users.  "Female" buyers have the highest ratio of "Purchase Count" to "User Count".

Female                  : 1.395
Male                    : 1.347
Other / Non-Disclosed   : 1.363

#3

The age ratios and gender ratios of the users who buy items (the users in this dataset) are exactly the same as the ratios that are given for the overall "active player group".
This would lead me to believe that age and gender are not key factors in determining the likelihood that an active user will also be an item purchaser.
If they were key features then the ratios would have differed, as an example if "Female" users were more likely to buy items they would have a higher percentage in the user breakdown of item purchasers than they do overall active players, their percentage would have been much higher than 14%.
